# My calculator #

The program performs basic mathematical operations and has several functions that I need in my work.

  **List of operations:**
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Calculation of fuel mass
- Calculation of fuel volume

## My additional functionality ##

**Calculation of fuel mass**

The calculation of fuel mass is made according to the basic indicators obtained during sampling during the acceptance of petroleum products. The calculation results are approximate!
The calculations use the known volume and density of the fuel at the time of measurement, the calculation formula is `m = vol * ro`, where `ro` - is the density `vol` - is the volume of the petroleum product.

The calculation of the fuel volume is made according to the basic indicators obtained during sampling during the acceptance of petroleum products. The calculation results are approximate!
The calculations use the known mass and density of the fuel at the time of measurement, the calculation formula is `vol = m / ro`, where `ro` - is the density `m` - is the mass of the petroleum product.

## Below will be a description of new features and updates. ##
